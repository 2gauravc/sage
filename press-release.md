# WBL Bank product managers staff use AI to find customer needs

Product Managers (PMs) have always been hampered by lack of data insights on the customer portfolios. The insights are hidden in the customer data; hidden in many applications, data tables, data marts and technical tools. 
tools. Tradionally RMs have relied on an army of Data Analysts (DAs) to fetch them this information. This leads to time lost in translation between the Product MAnager and the Data Analyst. Also Data Analysts are expensive resources. 

WBL bank has found a novel solution for this problem. Sage, an AI boot, takes in data queries in natural language and translates them into a technical question for the database tables; in a language called SQL. This SQL can fetch the data needed and display it to the Product Managers. Ta Da !
