# WBL Bank product managers use AI to find customer needs

Product Managers (PMs) need insights from data to understand what customers need. While there is a deluge of data, the insights are often hidden; across applications, data tables, data marts and behind technical tools. 

Tradionally PMs have relied on Data Analysts (DAs) to fetch them these insights. As the volume of data is ever increasing, so is the need for DAs to connect the dots. As a result, WBL is always short of good DAs. 

WBL bank has found a novel solution for this problem. Sage, an AI boot, takes in data queries in natural language and returns the right data set or data visualization.  Under the hood, Sage first translates the natural language query into a SQL query, the language of databases. The data is then converted into a graph or chart, as needed. Ta Da !
