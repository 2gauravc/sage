# WBL Bank product managers use AI to find customer needs

Product Managers (PMs) need data insights to understand what customers need. The data insights hep the PMs in product design, marketing and personalization of products / services to customer needs. The insights are often hidden in the deluge of data; across applications, data tables, data marts and behind technical tools. Tradionally PMs have relied on Data Analysts (DAs) to fetch them these insights. DAs use tools such as SAS or Python to extract and manipulate data and glean valuable customer understanding. 

However as the the volume of data keeps increasing, so does the need for more DAs. As a result WBL is perenially short of DAs.   

WBL bank has found a novel solution for this problem. Sage, an AI bot, takes in data queries in natural language and returns the right data set.  Under the hood, Sage first translates the natural language question into a SQL query, the language of databases. The SQL query is passed to the database to fetch the right data. The data is converted into a graph or chart, as needed, and displayed to the PM. Ta Da !

Sage uses OpenAI APIs (Codex and GPT-3) to translate natural lanugage to a SQL query. OpenAI is a research organization whose mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. OpenAI is founded by tech entrepneurs (Elon Musk is one of them) and is funded by Microsoft, Y Combinator, among others. 

Sage is now live and being used across multiple business domains - including marketing campaigns, product development, KYC/AML and sales /relationship management. WBL has structured a workflow around the tool,  where the PMs interact with Sage and if needed, can get help from a Data Analyst to improve the query. This feedback from the PM and the data analyst is captured and used to continuously train and improve the underlying model. 

WBL has also restructued their team to cater to the new process. The Data Analysts, free from day to day queries, now focus on creating reusable data assets that power Sage. The bank has upskilled one of the DAs to be the product manager of Sage. 

WBL developed Sage in an AGILE manner - with bi-weekly sprints to deliver incremental product improvements. A team of Product Managers, Data Analysts worked with other problem solvers to develope prototypes, evaluate accuracy and train the model. Sage has been funded by an innovation grant from the banking regulator, NBT. 

Mr Joffra Archer, Head of Innovation at NBT said that this is a revolutionay project to improve the employee journey via AI.  This is a shining example of adpating general purpose AI to fit your business need to quickly derive benefit. 

WBL's head of innovation, Mr David K, said "We are now building on this success. We have instituted a team to bring in general purpose AI and adapt it to solve our hairiest business problems."
